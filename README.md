# Data-Science-Portfolio-Class
Hi! My name is Mia Coutts and Iâ€™m a Data Science major at Belmont University graduating in May 2024. This is my semester research project for my DSC 4900 Data Science Project/Portfolio course. This project analyzes Massachusetts Public School data from 2017, with a specific interest in predicting SAT scores.
I created a website displaying some of my findings including interactive visuals!
